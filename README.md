My Portfolio.

My first website created using Semantic HTML and my first foray into Vanilla JavaScript.
I wanted to create little pop ups and modals for my projects so I did this using JS.

Unfortunately I have since learned that my code repeats itself alot and so it is not DRY whatsoever.
The functions I created per project, using JavaScript to code the HTML and therefore each function is v specific to the project.

A future project will be to recreate a portfolio in REACT using props and functions to reuse components.

In terms of the design. I often feel dev portfolios are very dark and samey, so I wanted to create something simple, bright and modern. I hope you enjoy it :)
